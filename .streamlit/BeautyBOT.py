st.write("""Due to the strong predicted growth of the beauty industry non-specialist retailers are now also entering the market and it is therefore becoming highly saturated. 

**70%** of beauty consumers are overwhelmed by too many beauty product choices.

With the rise of online shopping, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the growing demand for personalisation, consumers are becoming increasingly demanding and expecting immediate results. BeautyBOT can meet these expectations by providing instant recommendations that are tailored to each individual user.

As the beauty industry continues to grow, it is clear that retailers need to turn to technology to set themselves apart and provide more personalised experiences for their customers.

BeautyBOT is at the forefront of this trend, offering a solution that provides customers with detailed recommendations from across all brands and products, without the need to download multiple apps, essentially becoming the Netflix of beauty.

### "Netflix of Beauty" 

Companies that can provide the most innovative and personalised experiences for their customers will be the ones that succeed. A brand-neutral interface, such as BeautyBOT, that offers unlimited recommendations, will help retailers drive growth and increase sales and profits.""")
