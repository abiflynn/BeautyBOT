   st.write("""I am an accomplished analyst and merchandiser seeking to transition my career to a data science role. With over four years of experience as a Merchandiser at retail giant Next, I have enhanced my numerical and analytical skills and developed strong communication, teamwork, and management skills.

Having always had a strong passion for problem solving, I moved into a Project Analyst role. In this position, I led multiple projects across various areas within Next to invent new processes and implement them effectively. Through this role, I gained invaluable skills in stakeholder management, leadership, and data analysis.

I am passionate about using data analysis to influence business decisions and drive growth and profitability. To further develop my skills in this area, I recently completed the Data Science Bootcamp at the WBS Coding School. 

Through this program, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the data science field and developed a range of technical skills, including SQL, Python, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Automation, Tableau, and A/B Testing.

As a quick learner who enjoys embracing new challenges, I am excited about the next steps in my career and look forward to developing my skills further make a valuable contribution and help drive growth and success.
